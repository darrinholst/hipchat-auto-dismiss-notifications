# Hipchat Auto Dismiss Notifications

Hipchat uses window.Notification if available and only closes the notification
on click. This changes that behavior to use webkitNotifications which auto
closes the notification after 5 seconds.

Apparently I'm only seeing this sticky notifications on Windows though.

Get it in the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hipchat-auto-dismiss-noti/nmindifmgoccchgnkojbjoppdpcdblim)
